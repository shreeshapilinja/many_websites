        <h2>To all the Teachers of Vivekananda College of Engineering & Technology : By Shreesha B</h2>
        <h3>A teacher is a great source of knowledge, prosperity, and enlightenment by which anybody can benefit. Teachers are the gifts of God who shape our careers and guide us toward success. Teachers make their students academically strong, and they always encourage their students to do better in their lives. I learned so much from our Vivekananda College teachers. Heartfuls thank you to all for helping me become a better person.</h3>
